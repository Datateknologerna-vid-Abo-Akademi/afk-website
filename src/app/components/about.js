                <p>Albins Företagskonferens AFK is a recruitment fair organized by <Links name="Datateknologerna vid Åbo Akademi rf" link="https://datateknologerna.org/"/>, aimed at students from Åbo Akademi University and the University of Turku. The event was organized for the first time in the spring of 2024 and we got very positive feedback from both companies and students.</p> 
                <br /> 
                <p>This year we are expanding the fair to include even more participants and events, with the aim of improving the experience for students and company representatives alike.</p>
